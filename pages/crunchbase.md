## Exploring the crunchbase datasets using SQL

**Project description**

The data is from Crunchbase and was extracted via Kaggle. It was collected on 17 November 2020.
This free dataset starts in 1960 and is current as of October 2013 (before Crunchbase switched to a paid API model).

**Main questions** 

1. What type of funding is the most frequent through time? What type of funding does raise the highest amount?
2. What kind of categories/industries that attracted the highest amount of investment?
3. Where can we look for new entrepreneurs/startups? 

**Results**

This is the interactive dashboard with the end results after analysis using SQL.
