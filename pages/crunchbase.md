## Exploring the crunchbase datasets using SQL

**Project description**

The data came from [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) and was extracted via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arindam235/startup-investments-crunchbase). It was collected on 17 November 2020.
This free dataset starts in 1960 and is current as of October 2013 (before Crunchbase switched to a paid API model).

**Main questions** 

1. What type of funding is the most frequent through time? What type of funding does raise the highest amount?
2. What kind of categories/industries attracted the highest amount of investment?
3. Where can we look for new entrepreneurs/startups? 

**Results**

This is the interactive dashboard with the end results after analysis using SQL.
