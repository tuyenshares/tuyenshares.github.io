## Amalysing the HackerRank Developer Survey with a gender-focus perspective to empower more women in tech


**Project description**

In this project, I explored the data from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). 

The dataset was extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hackerrank/developer-survey-2018.


 

**Objectives** 

The aim for this project is to find actionable insights to empower more women in tech.

I was focusing on these 3 questions:

1. What is the situation of the gender gap in the tech industry?
2. Is there any variable explaning the situation?
3. What can be done? 


**Results**

This is the interactive dashboard using Power BI.
